<p>This crazy looking phrase belongs to one of the greatest free thinkers and philosophers of all time, Socrates. Sold on learning Greek? Probably not so much, but in fact, learning Greek can actually help you understand the English language and who doesn't want to learn more about that. Not to mention you can impress that unannounced greek scholar model at your next cocktail party, who knew the Greek language could be so useful. </p>

<p>Definitely the biggest learning curve with the Greek language is the alphabet, and honestly there's really no shortcuts besides learning it. Without further ado, let's begin.  </p>

<p>Here are some words that are innately greek in the English language. A good practice to learning Greek is to write out the alphabet and then write out a couple of words. The word Genesis for instance is Greek in origin and its written form is Γενεσις. There are two versions of "s" or sigma in greek, the ς is the "s" that is used to end sentences whereas σ is used within the word. Try these words below by just matching the letters with the greek letters. Boom! Some Greek has been learned!</p>

<p>Drama, basis, comma, acropolis</p>

<p>Here are some interesting words to read aloud and can connect to the English language:</p>

<p>γραφω - to write: read "Grapho" similar to graffiti or writing and scribbling</p>

<p>θεραπευω - to heal, cure: read "Therapeuo" as in Therapeutics</p>

<p>αγορα - market: read "Agora" as in your traditional marketplace</p>

<p>επιστολη - letter: read "Epistola" as in an epistle</p>

<p>ναυτης - sailor: read "Nautaes" as in nautical</p>

<p>Περσης - Persian: read "Persaes" as in Persian</p>

<p>ποιητης - Poet: read "Poiatas" as in Poet</p>

<p>λογος - word: read "Logos" as in ethos, pathos, logos</p>

<p>δενδρον - branch: read "Dendron" as in dendrites in the human brain</p>

<p>δεσποτης - master: read "Despotas" as in a despot </p>

<p>ἁνθρωπος - man: read "Anthropos" as in anthropomorphic</p>

<p>Here is just a quick start to some Greek. The best way is to learn the alphabet and try pronouncing and writing out some words in Greek yourself. You can always use this to impress your buddies or understand origins of words. If you are bad at remembering long words in English, Greek always helps. Say for instance you can never remember what anthropology means in English. Well you now know the word ανθρωπος in Greek means "man" and a further extension of that would be anthropology or the study of man. This can be used for a whole range of words because Greek and Latin heavily influenced our present languages today. Next lesson will be more interactive as I will be installing some check boxes so you can try out your Greek sentences real time!</p>
