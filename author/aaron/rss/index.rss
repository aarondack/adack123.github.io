&lt;p&gt;It was a Wednesday when I first drove down, Waco to Austin a relatively short drive. I will always tell her that I wasn't nervous, but I'm sure there were some butterflies. I thought about what I was going to say and what I was going to do, would I be an awkard squirrel or talk to much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I would get lost. Why not. How simple is it to follow maps to an address? Apparently not that simple. I had to call her, but this had to be the first time we will talk on the phone. The phone call went like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron: "Hello" &lt;br&gt;
Alyssa: "Ugh Hi" &lt;br&gt;
Aaron: "I'm lost, Can you help me" &lt;br&gt;
Alyssa: "Laugh" &lt;br&gt;
Alyssa: "Laugh" &lt;br&gt;
Alyssa: "I'll be right out!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys conceding on not knowing directions. Especially on the first date? Of course. My life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued. Alyssa is on skype.&lt;/p&gt;
