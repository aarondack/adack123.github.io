<p>It was a Wednesday when I first drove down, Waco to Austin a relatively short drive. I will always tell her that I wasn't nervous, but I'm sure there were some butterflies. I thought about what I was going to say and what I was going to do, would I be an awkard squirrel or talk to much. </p>

<p>Of course I would get lost. Why not. How simple is it to follow maps to an address? Apparently not that simple. I had to call her, but this had to be the first time we will talk on the phone. The phone call went like this.</p>

<p>Aaron: "Hello" <br>
Alyssa: "Ugh Hi" <br>
Aaron: "I'm lost, Can you help me" <br>
Alyssa: "Laugh" <br>
Alyssa: "Laugh" <br>
Alyssa: "I'll be right out!"</p>

<p>Guys conceding on not knowing directions. Especially on the first date? Of course. My life. </p>

<p>To be continued. Alyssa is on skype.</p>
