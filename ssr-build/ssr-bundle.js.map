Surely, you would ask, with today’s\n        technologies if a painting is hidden in plain sight it has to be found, or maybe it doesn’t\n        exist at all? The painting in question is “The Battle of Anghiari”, which was commissioned\n        in 1505 to adorn the Palazzo Vecchio’s Hall of the Five Hundred in Florence. At the height\n        of his artistic powers, once started, this painting was considered to be the greatest work\n        that Da Vinci would complete not only for its grandiose appearance but also for its level of\n        intricacy. Lost since the 1500's, recently there have been new developments into the\n        potential rediscovery of this treasure.\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        The theory as postulated by the art historian Maurizio Seracini is that the painting is\n        hidden behind Giorgio Vasari’s fresco, “The Battle of Marciano in Val Di Chiani” in the Hall\n        of the Five Hundreds. In the fresco there is a portion with a Florentine militant waving a\n        green flag with the words “Cerca trova”, in English, “He who seeks, finds”. Is it possible\n        that this truly is a clue left by Vasari to the true whereabouts of the now dubbed “Lost\n        Leonardo” painting?\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        Telling the story of a potential discovery of the painting by Seracini followed by more\n        endeavors with the Italian government to free resources and access the often packed Palazzo\n        Vecchio would be interesting, but at the end of the day the painting would mean nothing to\n        you. It is a common event for people to blow through museums disregarding great paintings\n        and ancient artifacts, and the reason is simple. Why care about something you know nothing\n        about? The story of the Battle of Anghiari is not just simply Da Vinci at the peak of his\n        career with a freak accident, but also a tale of genius, greed, and even jealousy by the\n        great Michelangelo himself.\n      </Content>\n      <SectionTitle>\n        <Brackets>#</Brackets>\n        The year is 1505.\n      </SectionTitle>\n      <Content>\n        Leonardo Da Vinci has recently been commissioned by Piero Soderini to paint the greatest\n        fresco that Florence has ever known, and it is to be placed within the Palazzo Vecchio. A\n        year before Michelangelo recently completed arguably the greatest sculpture of all time,\n        “The David”, in which he toiled over his marble for four years. But what few know is that\n        Michelangelo actually wasn’t first choice to carve the famed duomo block. Just before the\n        carving started in 1501 Da Vinci was actually asked first to carve the block, and his\n        response to this request inevitably left a sour taste in Michelangelo’s mouth. Da Vinci\n        says, “Sculpture, a very noble art, is one that does not in the execution require the same\n        supreme ingenuity as the art of painting, since in two most important and difficult\n        particulars, in foreshortening and in light and shade... the painter has to invent a\n        process, [whereas] sculpture is helped by nature.” It is true that Michelangelo’s first and\n        only love was sculpture, that he was tormented by the painting of the Sistine Chapel almost\n        to death, and even after finishing the Sistine all he wanted was to carve marble. Naturally,\n        Da Vinci’s lack of appreciation for sculpture irked Michelangelo. On top of this, Soderini\n        actually offered Da Vinci more money for the painting of the Hall compared to carving a\n        fourteen foot block of marble. This was actually commonplace in Italy, painting was often\n        considered of more value than a sculpture. Not surprisingly, when Da Vinci was commissioned\n        one side of the Hall of the Five Hundred Michelangelo begged to paint the other side. What\n        would be better than proving your worth to the world than beating the master at his own\n        trade? It is known that Michelangelo had an obsessive personality, he was an inexorable\n        force for perfection; the Sistine chapel was restarted and he fired his entire staff so he\n        could paint it himself. So, when the opportunity presented itself to paint the other side he\n        decided on a similarly themed painting named “The Battle of Cascina”. Today we have neither\n        paintings, so what exactly happened?\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        It was sort of like a bad love story. Michelangelo was very private with his work, opting to\n        show few and only allowing trusted friends to come sketch off the cartoon. Da Vinci, who\n        idling with one project was never his forte was naturally experimenting with engineering,\n        medicine, and the kitchen sink. While Michelangelo might be argued to be the greatest\n        painter and sculptor to live, Da Vinci is likewise argued to have possessed the most\n        widespread talents of any one individual. Alongside innovating other areas of education, Da\n        Vinci was actually attempting a new way of plastering the painting which in doing so left it\n        completely ruined. It’s actually slightly more complicated than that but no one wants to be\n        bored with artistic jargon. One thing to note, Michelangelo might not have liked Da Vinci\n        but he definitely admired him. Really, they both admired each other. Once Michelangelo got\n        wind of the tragedy of the fresco he abandoned painting his. The world went from two of the\n        greatest painters to ever have lived painting beautiful frescos on the historic walls in the\n        Palazzo Vecchio to a ruined painting and a mere cartoon by Michelangelo. In the end it does\n        have feelings of a bad love story or maybe it really wasn’t meant to be. Michelangelo\n        stopped because there was no competition and Da Vinci ruined his greatest work and it is\n        lost forever. Or is it?\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        Currently, Seracini is on hold. He was allowed to drill into Vasari’s frescos and even\n        though he found “a rough coarse surface, with material” it has since been abandoned. As it\n        seems with all great discoveries the project has been shut down due to pressures of the\n        invasive techniques in finding the painting. Unfortunately for Seracini there has been no\n        definitive evidence of the painting existing behind Vasari's fresco. But, there is no\n        evidence suggesting that the painting doesn't exist. It's essentially all grey. In art,\n        there are two parties. The first party strongly feels that Da Vinci's work is behind the\n        fresco, and the other party is solely concerned with preserving Vasari's masterpiece, even\n        if it is at the expense of a Da Vinci discovery. Regardless, if found the work would be\n        completely ruined, but the intrigue in actually finding it is what drives this quest. Would\n        Vasari really hide a painting?

Enough on that though, if you are interested in the\n        workings of redux, I strongly suggest to visit their docs{' '}\n        <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/\">here</a>.\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        There are two main libraries right now that handles asynchronous processes for redux. The\n        first is redux-thunk, and the second is redux-saga. The main difference between thunk and\n        saga is that thunk utilizes promises while saga utilizes generator functions. Here at MSK we\n        are big advocates for redux-saga. One of the main reasons we love sagas is that it allows us\n        the ability to write code that looks synchronous but behaves asynchronously. This is\n        especially powerful for keeping a grasp of where you are in your app and the logic that is\n        driving your data fetching and processing. Besides that, the differences are quite small\n        between the two libraries, depending on whether you like to work with generators or\n        promises, and of course different API vernacular.\n      </Content>\n      <SectionTitle>\n        <Brackets>#</Brackets>\n        Working with API Requests - A Map Approach\n      </SectionTitle>\n      <Content>\n        There are a multitude of different ways to structure how you actually call an API, this is\n        just one technique that we are implementing, and in no means exhaustive. We are going to\n        construct our API map. First we are going to compose our header settings into an object that\n        we are calling <code> API_REQUEST_SETTINGS</code>\n      </Content>\n      <img src={apiImage} width=\"960\" />\n      <Content>\n        Here, we construct the apiRequestMap using some dummy endpoints. As you can see the\n        apiRequestMap is contained within an object. We place each different endpoint and its\n        associated HTTP actions as key-value pairs within the object. Next, we proceed to building\n        what we like to call the service, which in essence a plain function that takes the key-pair\n        selected and fetches it.\n      </Content>\n      <Content>For example...</Content>\n      <img src={apiService} width=\"960\" />\n      <Content>\n        We select on the apiRequestMap with its given type, and pass in associated data in this\n        line.\n      </Content>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code className=\"javascript language-javascript\">\n          const apiRequestConfiguration = apiRequestMap[type](data);\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>\n        From there, we now have the given key and passed in its accompanying data, so we just return\n        a fetch for that endpoint, combining the settings from the value in the apiRequestMap with\n        the given API<em>REQUEST</em>SETTINGS that we declared above.\n      </Content>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>\n          {`return fetch(apiRequestConfiguration.url, { \n            ...apiRequestConfiguration.settings,\n            ...API_REQUEST_SETTINGS, })`}\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>Which returns a promise that we handle gracefully here...</Content>\n\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>\n          {`\n      .then(res =>; {\n        if (res.status > 400) {\n          return res.json().then(err =>; {\n            throw err;\n          });\n        }\n        return res.json();\n      });\n    `}\n          }\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>\n        And that's it. From here on out we can just plug whatever endpoint we want into our\n        apiRequestMap and then just key on it to return our settings. But... where does redux-saga\n        come in? How would we call this dummyWebService?\n      </Content>\n      <SectionTitle>\n        <Brackets>#</Brackets>\n        Using Redux-Saga\n      </SectionTitle>\n      <Content>\n        This section requires some nascent understanding of how generators work, but altogether will\n        not be difficult to understand if you understand the methodologies underlying them.\n      </Content>\n      <Content>Here's what we like to call a watcher in redux-saga.</Content>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>\n          {`export function* watchFetchSomeFooData() {\n            while (true) {\n              const { someFooThing } = yield take(actions.REQUEST_SOME_ACTION);\n              yield call(fetchTheFooData, someFooThing);\n            }\n          }\n        `}\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>\n        For each type of action that you are listening for, there should be a separate watcher\n        function that listens for it. This is an infinite loop that is always running in the\n        background waiting for an action to be dispatched. When an action is dispatched the\n        generator yields on the action that gets dispatched to the store (That should be familiar\n        because its redux specific). Here we are destructuring our returned object on someFooThing\n        which could potentially have some useful information (userIds, page number to paginate API\n        with, etc). Next, we call our next generator function fetchTheFooData with the accompanying\n        object.\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        If you are curious as to what the actual yield return on an action take, you could....\n      </Content>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>const fooThing = yield take(actions.REQUEST_SOME_ACTION);</code>\n        <code>console.log(fooThing)</code>\n        <code>\n          // It ends up containing a lot of content related to the actual redux request, so usually\n          its best to destructure on the key you want from the object.\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>\n          {`export function* fetchTheFooData(someFooThing) {\n      const data = yield call(dummyWebService, 'postData', { someFooThing });\n      yield put(actions.RECEIVE_SOME_FOO_DATA(data));\n    `}\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>\n        Here is where we actually fetch the data. We call the dummyWebService that we created above\n        with two parameters, the key for the API endpoint that we are trying to access, and\n        optionally some data that we will pass in. In this case we are calling the dummyWebService\n        with the postData string and an object containing someFooThing data. This will enter into\n        the dummyWebService function and immediately get used in the first line here...\n      </Content>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>\n          {`const apiRequestConfiguration = apiRequestMap[type](data)\n            \n              AKA...\n            \n              const apiRequestConfiguration = apiRequestMap['postData']({ someFooThing });`}\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>This one-liner,</Content>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>{\"const data = yield call(dummyWebService, 'postData', { someFooThing });\"}</code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>\n        is all we have to wait on for our entire API response. We yield on it and smartly name our\n        variable data, which is the return of the API response. From their we can let our redux\n        store know that we have the data by dispatching some action named{' '}\n        <code>RECEIEVE_SOME_FOO_DATA</code> with the accompanying data. The 'put' method that\n        redux-saga exposes to us from their API is essentially just a way for us to dispatch an\n        action to our redux store.\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        Last, all we have to do is hook this saga up to our rootSaga and it will permanently listen\n        for any actions with a given type that is kicked off. It will then proceed to fetch the\n        data, and return it to your redux store.\n      </Content>\n      <PreCode>\n        <code>\n          {`export default function* rootSaga() {\n        yield [\n          fork(watchFetchSomeFooData),\n        ];\n      `}\n        </code>\n      </PreCode>\n      <Content>The reason we are using fork here is ... according to their docs ...</Content>\n      <blockquote>\n        fork, like call, can be used to invoke both normal and Generator functions. But, the calls\n        are non-blocking, the middleware doesn't suspend the Generator while waiting for the result\n        of fn. Instead as soon as fn is invoked, the Generator resumes immediately.\n      </blockquote>\n      <SectionTitle>Conclusion</SectionTitle>\n      <Content>\n        In the end, handling asynchronicity and concurrent computations is oftentimes painful and\n        difficult in applications. As the larger an application grows the need for a base to handle\n        all API requests as well as a way to gracefully consume the responses becomes apparent.\n        Luckily, redux-saga exposes a way for our applications to handle these challenges and does\n        so in a way allowing us to write synchronous looking code.\n      </Content>\n    </div>\n  );\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n

Without further ado, let's begin.\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        Here are some words that are innately greek in the English language. A good practice to\n        learning Greek is to write out the alphabet and then write out a couple of words. The word\n        Genesis for instance is Greek in origin and its written form is Γενεσις. There are two\n        versions of \"s\" or sigma in greek, the ς is the \"s\" that is used to end sentences whereas σ\n        is used within the word. Try these words below by just matching the letters with the greek\n        letters. Boom! Some Greek has been learned!\n      </Content>\n      <Content>Drama, basis, comma, acropolis</Content>\n      <Content>\n        Here are some interesting words to read aloud and can connect to the English language:\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        γραφω - to write: read \"Grapho\" similar to graffiti or writing and scribbling\n      </Content>\n      <Content>θεραπευω - to heal, cure: read \"Therapeuo\" as in Therapeutics</Content>\n      <Content>αγορα - market: read \"Agora\" as in your traditional marketplace</Content>\n      <Content>επιστολη - letter: read \"Epistola\" as in an epistle</Content>\n      <Content>ναυτης - sailor: read \"Nautaes\" as in nautical</Content>\n      <Content>Περσης - Persian: read \"Persaes\" as in Persian</Content>\n      <Content>ποιητης - Poet: read \"Poiatas\" as in Poet</Content>\n      <Content>λογος - word: read \"Logos\" as in ethos, pathos, logos</Content>\n      <Content>δενδρον - branch: read \"Dendron\" as in dendrites in the human brain</Content>\n      <Content>δεσποτης - master: read \"Despotas\" as in a despot </Content>\n      <Content>ἁνθρωπος - man: read \"Anthropos\" as in anthropomorphic</Content>\n      <Content>\n        Here is just a quick start to some Greek. The best way is to learn the alphabet and try\n        pronouncing and writing out some words in Greek yourself. You can always use this to impress\n        your buddies or understand origins of words. If you are bad at remembering long words in\n        English, Greek always helps. Say for instance you can never remember what anthropology means\n        in English. Well you now know the word ανθρωπος in Greek means \"man\" and a further extension\n        of that would be anthropology or the study of man. This can be used for a whole range of\n        words because Greek and Latin heavily influenced our present languages today.
